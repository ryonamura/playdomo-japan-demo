# Part 1: In-Depth Service Analysis

## Business Model Structure

```
[User] -> Purchase Booster Pack (or 1 free card daily / 10 tokens via postal request)
                |
         Random card drop + Cosmos earned (1 card = 1 Cosmos)
                |
         Spend Cosmos to enter prize draws (1 Cosmos = 1 chance)
                |
         Lottery for high-value physical prizes (Lamborghini, Rolex, etc.)
```

Official website's 3-step explanation:
1. **"Ouvre un Booster"** (Open a Booster)
2. **"Collectionne des Cartes et Gagne des Cosmos"** (Collect cards and earn Cosmos)
3. **"Tente ta chance"** / English version: **"Place your bet"**

> **Notable**: The English version explicitly uses **"Place your bet"** for the 3rd step. The French version also uses **"misez"** (place your bet). The company itself is using gambling terminology on its official site.

## Current Prizes (Confirmed on official site, February 23, 2026)

Listed under the "1 COSMOS = 1 CHANCE" section on the official website:

| Prize | Type | Est. Market Price | Fill Rate | Time Remaining |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Lamborghini Veneno** | Supercar (extremely rare, limited production worldwide) | **Approx. 500-600 million JPY** | 86% | 10 days 56 hours |
| **Rolex Batman** | Luxury watch (GMT-Master II BLNR) | **Approx. 2-3 million JPY** | 86% | Same |
| **Tissot PRX Auto** | Watch | **Approx. 80,000-150,000 JPY** | 86% | Same |

Official website text:
- FR: **"Tentez votre chance de gagner des prix exceptionnels. Collectionnez des cartes, misez et visez l'extraordinaire."** (Take your chance to win exceptional prizes. Collect cards, place your bet, and aim for the extraordinary.)
- EN: **"Take your chance to win exceptional prizes. Collect cards, Place your bet, and aim for the extraordinary."**

> **Analysis**: After removing the Ferrari, DOMO introduced the **even more expensive Lamborghini Veneno** (est. 500-600 million JPY). Far from retreating, DOMO is **escalating** its high-value physical prize strategy.

### Service Evolution

| Period | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **September 2025 (Launch)** | Ferrari and other cars as prizes. Tagline: "Entrez dans la loterie de vos reves" (Enter the lottery of your dreams) |
| **Post-Launch** | Ferrari prize removed citing insufficient participants. User complaints about refunds |
| **February 2026 (Current)** | Tagline changed to "La collection qui mene a l'exceptionnel." However, **Lamborghini Veneno (est. 500-600M JPY) + Rolex (2-3M JPY) newly introduced**. High-value prize strategy continues and escalates |

## Pack Structure

### Free Booster (Daily)
| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Cards | 1 card |
| Cosmos | Possibility to earn |
| Rarity | Commune 78% / Rare 22% |

### Premium Boosters (Paid)

| Pack | Cards | Cosmos | Rarity Distribution |
|------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **Decouverte (Discovery)** | 1 card | 1 guaranteed | Commune 65% / Rare 22% / Epique 10% / Legendaire 3% |
| **Essentiel (Essential)** | 5 cards | 5 guaranteed | Same |
| **Collection** | 10 cards | 10 guaranteed | Same |

> Specific prices are not published on the official site as they are in-app purchases. Whether the launch-era pricing (1-1,000 EUR) still applies requires confirmation.

### Free Participation Method (Postal)

Explicitly stated in the Participation Rules:
> "La Societe Organisatrice ouvre une voie alternative de participation en permettant a tout Participant d'obtenir des jetons de participation en dehors de l'achat de Produits"
> (The Organizing Company opens an alternative participation path allowing any Participant to obtain participation tokens without purchasing Products)

- **Up to 10 tokens can be obtained free of charge by postal request**
- This is a common legal technique in France to circumvent gambling regulations

# Part 2: Regulatory Compliance Analysis

## Critical Risk: Criminal Penalties

### 1. Lottery Crime (富くじ罪, Article 187 of the Penal Code) — Risk: Extremely High

**Penalty: Up to 2 years imprisonment or up to 1.5 million JPY fine**

| Element | DOMO's Applicability |
|---------|---------------------|
| Issuing lottery tickets and collecting money/goods | Selling packs to collect payments from numerous users |
| Determining winners by drawing | Cosmos used -> electronic drawing |
| Losers' losses fund winners' gains | Payments from many losing users fund Lamborghini and Rolex prizes |
| Organizer bears no financial risk | Pack sales revenue absorbs prize costs; difference becomes profit |

-> **Extremely high likelihood of meeting all 4 elements**

### 2. Gambling Crime (賭博罪, Article 185 of the Penal Code) — Risk: Extremely High

**Penalty: Up to 500,000 JPY fine or petty fine (科料)**

| Element | DOMO's Applicability |
|---------|---------------------|
| Outcome determined by chance | Random card drops + lottery drawing |
| Contesting gain or loss of property | Pack cost vs. Lamborghini Veneno (500-600 million JPY) |

The official site's use of "Place your bet" and "misez" (place your bet) would constitute extremely damaging evidence in the event of litigation.

Furthermore, the existence of the **cash alternative option** (stated in the Participation Rules) further strengthens applicability to the "contesting gain or loss of property" element.

-> **Maintaining the facade of a "sales contract" is impossible. The substance is gambling/lottery**

### 3. Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations (景品表示法, Premiums and Representations Act) — Risk: Extremely High

| Category | Upper Limit | DOMO's Prizes | Verdict |
|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| General Prize Promotions (一般懸賞) | 20x transaction value (max 100,000 JPY) | Lamborghini (500-600M JPY) | **Clearly illegal** |
| Universal Premiums (総付景品) | 20% of transaction value (max 200 JPY) | — | **Clearly illegal** |

### 4. Payment Services Act (資金決済法) — Risk: High (regarding Cosmos currency)

If Cosmos qualifies as "Prepaid Payment Instruments" (前払式支払手段), registration with the Financial Bureau and deposit obligations apply.

Characteristics per Terms of Use:
- Tied to individual, non-transferable
- No expiration
- Used for merchandise purchase + draw participation
- Non-convertible to cash

### 5. Act on Control and Improvement of Amusement Business (風営法, Amusement Business Act) — Risk: Medium

Following the November 2025 penalty enhancement, corporate fines raised to a maximum of 300 million JPY.

### Overall Risk Assessment

| Regulation | Risk Level | Criminal Penalty |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Lottery Crime (富くじ罪, Article 187 of the Penal Code)** | **Extremely High** | 2 years imprisonment / 1.5M JPY fine |
| **Gambling Crime (賭博罪, Article 185 of the Penal Code)** | **Extremely High** | 500,000 JPY fine |
| **Premiums and Representations Act Violation (景品表示法違反)** | **Extremely High** | Cease-and-desist order; criminal penalties added in 2024 amendment |
| **Amusement Business Act Violation (風営法違反)** | **Medium** | Up to 300M JPY fine (corporate) |
| **Payment Services Act Violation (資金決済法違反)** | **High** | Penalties for non-registration |

---

## Regulatory Status in France

### JONUM Regulation (Effective February 2026)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Legal Basis | SREN Law, Articles 40 & 41 (adopted May 21, 2024) |
| Effective Date | February 7, 2026 |
| Scope | Monetary sacrifice + element of chance + online + monetizable digital objects |
| Regulatory Authority | ANJ (Autorite Nationale des Jeux / National Gambling Authority) |
| Penalties for Violations | 3 years imprisonment + 90,000 EUR fine + 5% of revenue surcharge |

**DOMO's Compliance Status**: The Terms of Use and Participation Rules contain **no mention whatsoever** of JONUM regulations. DOMO positions itself as "jeux promotionnels par tirage au sort" (promotional sweepstakes games), potentially attempting to avoid classification as "jeux a objets numeriques monetisables" (games with monetizable digital objects) subject to JONUM.

DOMO's legal avoidance strategies:
1. **Classification as "promotional sweepstakes game"** — Claiming it is a promotion, not gambling
2. **Free postal participation** — Providing a purchase-free participation method to circumvent the "monetary sacrifice" element
3. **Cash alternative option** — Maintaining flexibility as a "change in prize nature"

-> However, it is unclear whether ANJ will accept this classification. There may be legal risk in France as well.

# Part 3: "Experience-based Model" Proposal for Japan

## Why an Experience-based Model?

Japan expansion under the current model is **impossible due to criminal penalty risk**. Based on attorney advice, we propose a **new model where prizes consist of "experiences/services with indeterminate value."**

### Legal Breakthrough

Insights from attorney consultation:

- **Experiences and services with indeterminate value** (e.g., aesthetic medicine, lessons with celebrities) may not constitute "contesting gain or loss of property" — an element required for the Gambling Crime (賭博罪)
- Experiences that are difficult to resell and for which objective market prices cannot be calculated significantly reduce Lottery Crime (富くじ罪) and Gambling Crime (賭博罪) risk
- Under the Premiums and Representations Act's (景品表示法) "valuation of premium goods" provisions, experiences not normally traded in the market are difficult to value

### Current Model vs. Experience-based Model

| Issue | Current Model | Experience-based Model |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Prizes** | Lamborghini, Rolex | Celebrity experiences, aesthetic medicine, Michelin dinners, etc. |
| **Gain/Loss of Property** | Clear property (cars, watches) -> **Constitutes gambling** | Experience ≠ property -> **Low applicability** |
| **Market Price** | Determined (500-600M JPY, 2-3M JPY, etc.) | **Indeterminate** (subjective value) |
| **Resale Potential** | Immediately resellable | Personal use only (**difficult to resell**) |
| **Convertibility to Cash** | Cash alternative option exists | **Extremely low** |
| **Premium Valuation** | Easy | **Difficult** |
| **Criminal Penalty Risk** | **Extremely high** | **Low to medium** |

### Three Legal Advantages of Experience-based Prizes

1. **Does not constitute "contesting gain or loss of property"**: Experiences/services are not "property" (財物) under criminal law
2. **Difficult to value**: Experiences not normally traded in the market cannot be objectively valued
3. **Cannot be resold**: Identity verification and accompanied experiences prevent secondary markets from forming

> **Caution**: Confirmation via formal legal opinion is required. Particularly, whether "providing an experience constitutes a property-related benefit in substance" requires careful examination.

## Japan Version Pack Pricing Design (Recommended)

To avoid criticism of excessive speculation, **the maximum price is capped at 5,000 JPY**.

|------|-------------------|----------|
| Standard Pack | 300 JPY | 3 cards + small amount of Cosmos |
| Silver Pack | 500 JPY | 5 cards + moderate amount of Cosmos |

| Platinum Pack | 3,000 JPY | 8 cards + extra-large amount of Cosmos + 1 guaranteed SR or above |

> **Caution**: Prizes that result in tangible deliverables should be individually reviewed with an attorney.

# Part 4: Risk Analysis of the Experience-based Model

## Risk Comparison: Current Model vs. Experience-based Model

| Regulation | Current Model | Experience-based Model | Change |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Lottery Crime (富くじ罪)** | Extremely High | **Low to Medium** | Significant improvement |
| **Gambling Crime (賭博罪)** | Extremely High | **Low to Medium** | Significant improvement |
| **Premiums and Representations Act (景品表示法)** | Extremely High | **Medium** | Significant improvement |
| **Amusement Business Act (風営法)** | Medium | **Low** | Improved |
| **Payment Services Act (資金決済法)** | High | **Medium to High** | Slightly improved |

### Residual Risks and Countermeasures

**1. Gambling Crime / Lottery Crime (賭博罪・富くじ罪) (Risk: Low to Medium)**
- Improvement: Experiences do not constitute "property" (財物)
- Residual risk: Possibility of being deemed "property-related benefit" (財産上の利益)
- Countermeasures: Frame experiences as educational/cultural elements; design to prevent resale; obtain formal legal opinion

**2. Premiums and Representations Act (景品表示法) (Risk: Medium)**
- Improvement: Experience valuation is difficult
- Countermeasures: Design provision costs within premium cap (100,000 JPY); cap pack price at 5,000 JPY

**3. Payment Services Act (資金決済法) (Risk: Medium to High)**
- Current favorable points: Cosmos is non-transferable, non-convertible, no expiration
- Countermeasures: Design as "in-game points"; clarify legal nature with attorney

**4. JOGA/CESA Guidelines** (Japan Online Game Association / Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association)
- Mandatory probability disclosure, pity system (recommended: within 100 pulls = 30,000 JPY)
- Avoid "complete gacha" (コンプガチャ, requiring collection of all 78 cards for a bonus is risky)
- Set spending limits for users under 18

---

# Part 5: Go-to-Market Strategy

## Positioning: "A New Category — Neither Gacha Nor Oripa"

| Existing Category | DOMO Japan Version |
|---|---|
| Gacha = Pull for digital items | **Pull for experiences** |
| Oripa (オリパ, original pack) = Receive physical cards | **Receive one-of-a-kind experiences** |
| Lottery = Win money | **Win experiences money can't buy** |

**Tagline concept**: "What you pull is an experience." (引くのは、体験だ。)

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Gacha/oripa spenders (ages 20-35, monthly entertainment budget 20,000-50,000 JPY)
- **Secondary**: Experience-oriented consumers (ages 25-40, valuing experiences over possessions)

## Influencer Strategy

The core is a 4-stage content cycle of the winning experience:
1. Gacha stream -> 2. Win announcement -> 3. Experience documentary -> 4. Post-experience review

# Part 8: Report & Proposals for DOMO Headquarters

## Report

1. **Launching in Japan with the current model (high-value physical prize lottery for Lamborghini, Rolex, etc.) carries an extremely high risk of constituting the Lottery Crime (富くじ罪, up to 2 years imprisonment) and the Gambling Crime (賭博罪)**

2. **The expressions "Place your bet" on the English site and "misez" on the French site would constitute extremely damaging evidence if legally challenged in Japan**

3. **The existence of the cash alternative option (stated in the Participation Rules) confirms that this is a system where monetary gain or loss is at stake**

4. **Under the Premiums and Representations Act (景品表示法), premiums attached to transactions are capped at 100,000 JPY. A Lamborghini (500-600 million JPY) is clearly illegal**

5. **Akatsuki Inc. is a publicly listed company in Japan, making reputational risk extremely significant**

6. **Compliance with the JONUM regulation is unclear even in France itself. The Terms of Use contain no mention of JONUM, and risk depends on ANJ's interpretation**

## Proposals

7. **Propose pivoting to an "Experience-based Model" for Japan**: Replacing prizes with "experiences/services of indeterminate value" significantly reduces criminal penalty risk

8. **Set the Japan version pack price cap at 5,000 JPY**

9. **Request approval to execute Phase 0 (obtaining legal opinion)**: Investment of 2-4 million JPY

10. **If Japan expansion succeeds, the Experience-based Model can be horizontally deployed to other countries** — This is also meaningful as a global strategy
